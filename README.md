# Introduction
Welcome to [CoinMEX][] API document for developers.

This document provides instructions on how to use APIs related to account management, market information, trading functions among others in spot trading.

Market API provides market data that are accessible to the public. Account APIs and trading APIs, which provide functions such as order placement, order cancellation, order inquiry and account information, need identity authentication.

# Getting Started

REST, a.k.a Respresntational State Transfer, is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints and properties based on HTTP. REST is known for its clear structure, readability, standardization and scalability. Its advantages are as follows:

+ Each URL represents one web resource in RESTful architecture;
+ Acting as a representation of resources between client and server;
+ Client is enabled to operate server-side resources with 4 HTTP requests - representational state transfer.

Developers are recommended to use REST API to proceed spot trading and withdrawals.

# Encrypted Verification of API
## Generate an API Key

Before signing any request, you must generate an API key via CoinMEX’s official website 【User Center】- 【API】. After generating the key, there are three things you must bear in 
mind:
* API Key

* Secret

* Passphrase

API Key and Secret are randomly generated and provided.

## Initiate a Request

All REST requests must include the following headings:

* ACCESS-KEY api key as a string.
* ACCESS-SIGN uses base64-encoded signatures (see Signed Messages).
* ACCESS-TIMESTAMP is the timestamp of your request.
* ACCESS-PASSPHRASE is the password you specified when you generate the API key. 
* All requests should contain content like application/json and be valid JSON.

## Signature

The ACCESS-SIGN header is the output generated by using HMAC SHA256 to create the HMAC SHA256 using the BASE64 decoding secret key in the prehash string to generate timestamp + method + requestPath + body (where ‘+’ represents the string concatenation) and BASE64 encoded output. The timestamp value is the same as the ACCESS-TIMESTAMP header. This body is the request body string or omitted if there is no request body (usually the GET request). **This method should be capitalized.**

Remember that before using it as the key to HMAC, base64 decoding (the result is 64 bytes) is first performed on the 64-bit alphanumeric password string. In addition, the digest output is base64 encoded before sending the header.

User submitted parameters must be signed except for sign. First, the string to be signed is ordered according to the parameter name (first compare the first letter of all parameter names, in alphabetic order, if you encounter the same first letter, then you move to the second letter, and so on).

**For example, if we sign the following parameters**

```java
Timestamp = 1590000000.28
Method = "GET"
requestPath = "https://www.coinmex.com/api/v1/spot/ccex/orders"
body = {
    "code=btc-usdt",
    "type=buy",
    "price=680",
    "amount=1.0"
};
```

Generate the string to be signed   
```
Message = '1590000000.28/GEThttps://www.coinmex.com/api/v1/spot/ccex/orders'+body.encode('utf-8')
```
Then, the character to be signed is added with the private key parameters to generate the final character string to be signed.

For example:
```
hmac = hmac(secretkey, Message, SHA256)
Signature = base64.encode(hmac.digest())
```

## Select timestamp

The ACCESS-TIMESTAMP header must be the number of seconds since UTC's time Unix Epoch. Decimal values are allowed. Your timestamp must be within 30 seconds of the API service time, otherwise your request will be considered expired and rejected. If you think there is a large time difference between your server and the API server, then we recommend that you use the time point to check the API server time.

## Request Process 
  
The root URL for REST access：`https://www.coinmex.com`

### Request
All requests are based on Https protocol, contentType in the request header must be uniformly set as: ‘application/json’.

**Request Process Descriptions**

1. Request parameter: parameter encapsulation based on the port request.

2. Submitting request parameter: submit the encapsulated parameter request to the server via POST/GET/PUT/DELETE or other methods.

3. Server response: the server will first perform a security validation, then send back the requested data to the client in JSON format.

4. Data processing: processing server response data.

**Success**

HTTP status code 200 indicates a successful response and may contain content. If the response contains content, it will appear in the corresponding returned content.

**Common Error Code**

* 400 Bad Request – Invalid request format

* 401 Unauthorized – Invalid API Key

* 403 Forbidden – You do not have access to the requested resource

* 404 Not Found

* 429 Too Many Requests

* 500 Internal Server Error – We had a problem with our server

### Pagination
All REST requests that return datasets use cursor-based pagination.

Cursor-based pagination allows results to be obtained before and after the current page of the result and is well suited for real-time data. The subsequent requests can specify the direction of the requested data based on the current returned results, before and/or after it. The before and after cursors can be used by the response headers CB-BEFORE and CB-AFTER. 

**For example:**

`GET /orders?before=2&limit=30`

## Standards and Specification

### Timestamp

Unless otherwise specified, all timestamps in APIs are returned in microseconds.

### For example,

1524801032573

### Numbers

In order to maintain the accuracy of cross-platform, decimal numbers are returned as strings. We suggest that you might be better to convert the number to string when issuing the request to avoid truncation and precision errors. Integers (such as transaction number and sequence) do not need quotation marks.


## Access Restriction

### REST API

* Public interface: We limit the invocation of public interface via IP: up to 6 requests every 2s.

* Private interface: We limit the invocation of private interface via user ID: up to 6 requests every 2s.

* Special restrictions on specified interfaces are specified.
